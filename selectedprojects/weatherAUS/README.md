For this project, I will explore the dataset to understand the nature of Australia's weather. Additionally, I will compare the accuracy of several models in predicting if it will rain the next day with the given variables. The models I will evaluating are: 
1) Decision Trees
2) Random Forest
3) Gradient Boosting
4) k Nearest Neighbor (k-NN)
5) Naïve Bayes’

**weatherAUS.csv**: dataset used for models 1-4.
